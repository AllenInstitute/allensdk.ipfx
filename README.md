Welcome to allensdk.ipfx
========================

allensdk.ipfx is a python 2/3 package for computing intrinsic cell features from electrophysiology data.  This includes:
   
    * action potential detection (e.g. threshold time and voltage)
    * cell quality control (e.g. resting potential stability)
    * stimulus-specific cell features (e.g. input resistance)

This software is designed for use in the Allen Institute for Brain Science electrophysiology data processing pipeline.
